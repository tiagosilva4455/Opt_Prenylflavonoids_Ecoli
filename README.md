### Abstract

The multiple health benefits from prenylflavonoids make them great compounds for different therapies, but the problem of their availability makes these therapies unviable and expensive. With the help of *in silico* metabolic modeling, it is possible to create a strain of Escherichia coli that synthesizes this type of compound. In this project computation strain optimizations were made to try and create an increase in the production of 8 prenylnaringenin and xanthohumol in *Escherichia coli*. 
In this project it was only achieved reliable production in one of the compounds proposed but at low rates.
